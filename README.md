# SOLID

### Single Responsibility Principle
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.

### Open Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle
A sub-class should be able to fulfill each feature of its parent class and could be treated as its parent class.

### Interface Segregation Principle
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they canâ€™t do. 
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
